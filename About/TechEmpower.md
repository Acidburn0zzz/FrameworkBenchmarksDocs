##What does TechEmpower Have to do with the Framework Benchmarks?

In a [March 2013 blog entry](https://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/28/frameworks-round-1/), we published the results of comparing the performance of several web application frameworks executing simple but representative tasks: serializing JSON objects and querying databases. Since then, community input has been tremendous. We—speaking now for all contributors to the project—have been regularly updating the test implementations, expanding coverage, and capturing results in semi-regular updates that we call "rounds."
