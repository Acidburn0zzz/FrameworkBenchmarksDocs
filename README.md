#WIKI UNDER DEVELOPMENT

__TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks__ is a performance comparison of many web application frameworks executing fundamental tasks such as JSON serialization, database access, and server-side template composition. Each framework is operating in a realistic production configuration. Results are captured on Amazon EC2 and on physical hardware. The project is still evolving, and as it does so, the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks) for the project is turning into a showcase of sorts for each framework's best-practices.

_Note: We're using the word "framework" loosely to refer to platforms, micro-frameworks, and full-stack frameworks._
