Each framework is operating in a realistic production configuration. Results are captured on Amazon EC2 and on physical hardware. The project is still evolving, and as it does so, the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks) for the project is turning into a showcase of sorts for each framework's best-practices.\r\n\r\n_Note: We're using the word \"framework\" loosely to refer to platforms, micro-frameworks, and full-stack frameworks._\r\n\r\n[Read more and see the latest results of our tests on Amazon EC2 and physical hardware](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/). \r\n\r\n###[TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/)\r\n\r\n####About\r\n* [Framework Benchmarks](/About/Framework-Benchmarks.md)\r\n* [TechEmpower](/About/TechEmpower.md)\r\n\r\n####Project Information\r\n* [Basic Concepts](/ProjectInformation/Concepts.md)\r\n* [Intro to Codebase - TODO](/ProjectInformation/Codebase.md)\r\n* [Framework Tests](/ProjectInformation/Framework-Tests.md)\r\n* [Environment](/ProjectInformation/Environment.md)\r\n* [Terminology](/ProjectInformation/Terminology.md)\r\n* [Expected Questions](/ProjectInformation//Expected-Questions.md)\r\n\r\n####Development\r\n* [Contributing Guide](/Development/Contributing-Guide.md)\r\n* [Getting Started](/Development/Getting-Started.md)\r\n* [Software Installation Guide](/Development/Installation-Guide.md)\r\n* [Add Frameworks or Tests](/Development/Add-Frameworks-or-Tests.md)\r\n* [Testing and Debugging](/Development/Testing-and-Debugging.md)\r\n\r\n####Benchmarking\r\n* [Getting Started](/Benchmarking/Getting-Started-Benchmarking.md)\r\n* [Run the Benchmark](/Benchmarking/Running-the-Benchmark.md)\r\n\r\n####Support\r\n* [FAQ](/Support/FAQ.md)\r\n* [Join the Conversation](/Support/Converse.md)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
